# How to use RBookDown {-}

Firstly, you will have to read the [RBookDown Bible](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) by YiHui Xie

In essence, you write in a mixture of markdown (For basics), html (to extend on markdown) and latex language (mostly for equations) to create a simple Note.

You can customise your style and theme through your own CSS. 

RMarkdown are mostly used to knit e-books(HTML), use TexStudio if you want a proper PDF, it is easier.

**Here are some useful tips to get started**

1: To add a chapter, just open a R file and save as `.RMD`. Use number 0 to 99 with a hyphen `-` to order the RMD files and maybe add a Chapter name so it is easier to select from `Files` window at bottom right of the R Studio. 

2: Code chunks can generate graphical outputs, To insert pictures just use `include_graphics` instead of `\includegraphics{}` or `![]()`. Width can be customised. 


```
knitr::include_graphics(rep('images/knit-logo.png', 3))
```

3: Use 1 grave accent ` to include the in line code, use 3 grave accent to include a chunk of code.
